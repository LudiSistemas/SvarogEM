**Svarog Event Monitoring**: Inspired by Slavic Heritage

As a Slavic individual with a deep appreciation for our cultural heritage, I named my event monitoring solution '**SvarogEM**' to draw upon the strength and inspiration of this mythological figure. Svarog, representing fire, the forge, and the sun, symbolizes power and transformation.

Svarog Monitoring aims to provide a reliable and simple tool for monitoring service providers, helping them navigate the dynamic landscape with confidence.
Just as Svarog forged the world, lavanet.xyz forged solutions to empower providers and developers and bring clarity to the crypto space. So lets help them :).
